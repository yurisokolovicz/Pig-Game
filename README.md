# Pig-Game

The "Pig-Game" project is a web development game developed using the JavaScript language. The object of the game is to roll dice and score points, but if the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in the current round. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game. The game is implemented with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure the interactivity and functionality of the game.

The Project is not finished yet.
