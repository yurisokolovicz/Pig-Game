# Pig-Game

The "Pig-Game" project is a web development game developed using the JavaScript language. The object of the game is to roll dice and score points, but if the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in the current round. The first player to reach a certain number of points (usually set to 100) wins the game. The game is implemented with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure the interactivity and functionality of the game.

The Project is not finished yet.
